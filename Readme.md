# How to make the TreeList control look like a TreeView


The TreeList control provides support for a TreeView visual style, in which the control mimics the appearance of the .NET standard TreeView control. Starting from version **17.2**, the TreeView visual style can be enabled using the single setting - [ViewStyle](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraTreeList.TreeList.ViewStyle.property).

## ***If the built-in [ViewStyle](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraTreeList.TreeList.ViewStyle.property) setting does not suit you, we will be happy to find the most appropriate solution for you if you describe your real-life scenario.
