# How to make the TreeList control look like a TreeView


The TreeList control provides support for a TreeView visual style, in which the control mimics the appearance of the .NET standard TreeView control. Starting from version **17.2**, the TreeView visual style can be enabled using the single setting - [ViewStyle](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraTreeList.TreeList.ViewStyle.property).
